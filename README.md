# IA-2-009 (0) Shortest Path Algorithm

A simple command line application. The application calculates the shortest path between nodes in a network of linked nodes. To do this, it uses an "algorithm" similar to the ones used by distance-vector routing protocols used by routers in computer networks.

**NOTE:** the interface of the application is in Swedish.
